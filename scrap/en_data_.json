express  their  opinions  and  beliefs  without  barriers  Free  expression  is  a  human  right  we  believe  that  everyone  has  a  voice  and  the  right  to  use  it  Our  role  is  to  serve  the  public  conversation  which  requires  representation  of  a  diverse  range  of  perspectives  We  recognise  that  if  people  experience  abuse  on  Twitter  it  can  jeopardize  their  ability  to  express  themselves  Research  has  shown  that  some  groups  of  people  are  disproportionately  targeted  with  abuse  online  This  includes  women  people  of  color  lesbian  gay

particularly  abuse  that  seeks  to  silence  the  voices  of  those  who  have  been  historically  marginalized  For  this  reason  we  prohibit  behavior  that  targets  individuals  with  abuse

depicts  lynchings  Inciting  fear  about  a  protected  category  We  prohibit  targeting  individuals  with  content  intended  to  incite  fear  or  spread  fearful  stereotypes  about  a  protected  category  including  asserting  that  members  of  a  protected  category  are  more  likely  to  take  part  in  dangerous  or  illegal  activities  all  religious  group  are  terrorists  Repeated  slurs  epithets  racist  and  sexist  tropes  or  other  content  that  degrades  someone  We  prohibit  targeting  individuals  with  repeated  slurs  tropes  or  other  content  that

disability  sexual  orientation  gender  identity  or  origin  Some  examples  of  hateful  imagery  include  but  are  not  limited  to  symbols  historically  associated  with  hate  groups  the

it  to  be  a  violation  of  the  Twitter  Rules  Some  Tweets  may  appear  to  be  hateful  when  viewed  in  isolation  but  may  not  be  when  viewed  in  the  context  of  a  larger  conversation  For  example  members  of  a  protected  category  may  refer  to  each  other  using  terms  that  are  typically  considered  as  slurs  When  used  consensually  the  intent  behind  these  terms  is  not  abusive  but  a  means  to  reclaim  terms  that  were  historically  used  to  demean  individuals  When  we  review  this  type  of  content  it  may  not  be  clear  whether  the  intention  is  to  abuse  an  individual  on  the  basis  of  their  protected  status  or  if  it  is  part  of  a  consensual  conversation  To  help  our  teams  understand  the  context  we  sometimes  need  to  hear  directly  from  the  person  being  targeted  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  information  needed  prior  to  taking  any  enforcement  action  Note  individuals  do  not  need  to  be  member  of  a  specific  protected  category  for  us  to  take  action  We  will  never  ask  people  to  prove  or  disprove  membership  in  any  protected  category  and  we  will  not  investigate  this  information  Consequences  Under  this  policy  we  take  action  against  behavior  that  targets  individuals  or  an  entire  protected  category  with  hateful  conduct  as  described  above  Targeting  can  happen  in  a  number  of  ways  for  example  mentions  including  a  photo  of  an  individual  referring  to  someone  by  their  full  name  etc  When  determining  the  penalty  for  violating  this  policy  we  consider  a  number  of  factors  including  but  not  limited  to  the  severity  of  the  violation  and  an  individual  s  previous  record  of  rule  violations  For  example  we  may  ask  someone  to  remove  the  violating  content  and  serve  a  period  of  time  in  mode  before  they  can  Tweet  again  Subsequent  violations  will  lead  to  longer  periods  and  may  eventually  result  in  permanent  account  suspension  If  an  account  is  engaging  primarily  in  abusive  behavior  or  is  deemed  to  have

taking  specific  automated  actions  on  Twitter  Please  read  these  rules  carefully  as  they  outline  both  permitted  and  prohibited  use  cases  of  automation  Automated  applications  or  activities  that  violate  these  rules  or  that  facilitate  or  induce  users  to  violate  them  may  be  subject  to  enforcement  action  including  suspension  of  associated  Twitter  accounts  We  may  also  rate  limit  suspend  or  terminate  developers  access  the  Twitter  API  based  on  violations  of  these  rules  As  a  reminder  you  should  also  carefully  review  the  spam  guidelines  in  the  Twitter  Rules  to  avoid  having  activities  performed  by  you  your  app  or  other  users  through  your  app  or  service  flagged  as  spam  A  Automated  Actions  Through  Another  User  s  Account  Twitter  users  may  authorize  your  app  or  service  to  access  their  Twitter  account  through  OAuth  A  user  authorizing  your  app  or  service  to  access  their  Twitter  account  through  OAuth  does  not  by  itself  constitute  sufficient  consent  to  take  automated  actions  through  that  user  s  account  You  may  only  take  automated  actions  through  another  Twitter  user  s  account  if  you  clearly  describe  to  the  user  the  types  of  automated  actions  that  will  occur  receive  express  consent  from  the  user  to  take  those  automated  actions  andimmediately  honor  a  user  s  request  to  of  further  automated  actions  If  you  substantially  change  the  purpose  or  functionality  of  your  app  or  service  you  must  express  consent  from  the  user  to  take  automated  action  through  their  account  before  doing  so  These  requirements  apply  to  any  automated  action  taken  through  another  Twitter  user  s  account  including  posting  Tweets  sending  Direct  Messages  deleting  Tweets  or  Direct  Messages  or  other  accounts  For  applications  that  offer  users  the  ability  to  delete  Tweets  in  a  bulk  or  automated  manner  you  must  also  clearly  state  that  Tweets  are  not  recoverable  once  deleted  B  Automated  Tweets  Posting  automated  Tweets  Automated  Tweets  that  outside  information  You  may  post  automated  Tweets  based  on  sources  of  outside  information  such  as  an  RSS  feed  weather  data  etc  as  long  as  you  are  sufficiently  authorized  to  publish  such  information  Other  automated  Tweets  excluding  mentions  or  replies  Provided  you  comply  with  all  other  rules  you  may  post  automated  Tweets  for  entertainment  informational  or  novelty  purposes  As  a  reminder  accounts  posting  duplicative  spammy  or  otherwise  prohibited  content  may  be  subject  to  suspension  Posting  automated  mentions  and  replies  The  reply  and  mention  functions  are  intended  to  make  communication  between  Twitter  users  easier  Automating  these  actions  to  reach  many  users  on  an  unsolicited  basis  is  an  abuse  of  the  feature  and  is  not  permitted  For  example  sending  automated  replies  to  Tweets  based  on  keyword  searches  alone  is  not  permitted  Spammy  or  duplicative  use  of  mentions  and  replies  may  result  in  enforcement  action  such  as  the  removal  of  your  Tweets  from  Search  or  the  suspension  of  your  app  or  account  However  you  may  send  automated  replies  or  mentions  to  Twitter  users  so  long  as  in  advance  of  sending  the  automated  reply  the  recipient  or  mentioned  user  s  have  requested  or  have  clearly  indicated  an  intent  on  Twitter  to  be  contacted  by  you  opted  in  for  example  by  replying  to  a  Tweet  from  your  account  or  by  sending  you  a  Direct  Message  you  provide  a  clear  and  easy  way  for  such  users  to  of  receiving  automated  replies  and  mentions  and  promptly  honor  all  such  requests  you  only  send  one  automated  reply  or  mention  per  user  interaction  andthe  automated  reply  or  mention  is  a  reply  to  the  user  s  original  Tweet  if  your  campaign  is  based  on  users  posting  a  reply  to  your  Tweet  techniques  and  indications  of  user  intent  take  many  different  forms  depending  on  the  specifics  of  your  use  case  and  implementation  Some  examples  include  A  Tweet  from  your  account  that  clearly  indicates  that  a  user  taking  a  specific  action  on  that  Tweet  such  as  Retweeting  it  will  opt  the  user  into  receiving  an  automated  mention  of  your  account  by  the  user  in  a  manner  suggesting  the  user  clearly  wishes  or  intends  to  receive  a  response  If  you  want  to  run  an  campaign  with  a  or  hashtag  users  should  also  mention  you  in  their  Tweets  Note  that  a  user  following  your  account  is  not  on  its  own  a  sufficient  indication  of  user  intent  to  receive  an  automated  response Note  Advertisers  publishers  and  brands  using  campaigns  must  request  approval  from  Twitter  and  may  be  subject  to  additional  rules  Please  reach  out  to  your  account  or  partner

Tweet  text  as  well  as  potentially  sensitive  media  Check  that  the  Tweet  you  are  mentioning  or  replying  to  still  exists  for  example  using  the  endpoint  on  the  Twitter  API  Automated  Direct  Messages  Sending  automated  Direct  Messages  to  users  You  may  not  send  unsolicited  Direct  Messages  in  a  bulk  or  automated  manner  and  should  be  thoughtful  about  the  frequency  with  which  you  contact  users  via  Direct  Message  You  may  send  automated  Direct  Messages  to  users  so  long  as  in  advance  of  sending  the  Direct  Message  the  recipient  s  have  requested  or  have  clearly  indicated  an  intent  on  Twitter  to  be  contacted  by  you  via  Direct  Message  for  example  by  sending  you  a  Direct  Message  and  you  provide  a  clear  and  easy  way  for  such  users  to  of  receiving  automated  Direct  Messages  and  promptly  honor  all  such  requests  The  fact  that  a  user  is  technically  able  to  receive  a  Direct  Message  from  you  because  the  user  follows  you  has  enabled  the  ability  to  receive  Direct  Messages  from  any  account  or  because  the  user  is  in  a  Direct  Message  conversation  with  you  does  not  necessarily  mean  they  have  requested  or  expect  to  receive  automated  Direct  Messages  from  you  Interacting  with  users  via  Direct  Message  Per  the  Ground  Rules  remember  to  be  thoughtful  about  the  amount  and  type  of  information  you  request  or  exchange  with  users  via  Direct  Messages  If  you  will  be  asking  a  user  to  provide  personal  or  private  information  via  an  automated  Direct  Message  you  must  clearly  explain  how  you  will  use  the  information  you  re  collecting  Consider  including  a  link  to  your  privacy  policy  in  your  Direct  Message  to  the  user  as  well  as  in  your  Twitter  profile  bio  Don  t  publicly  share  information  received  in  a  Direct  Message  conversation  with  a  user  without  first  obtaining  explicit  consent  from  the  user  For  example  if  a  user  asks  you  via  Direct  Message  about  a  purchase  they  made  from  you  you  may  not  mention  the  user  in  a  public  Tweet  that  includes  information  about  their  purchase  unless  you  have  the  user  s  explicit  consent  to  do  so  After  a  interaction  ends  don  t  send  additional  Direct  Messages  or  mention  users  in  a  Tweet  unless  you  get  permission  from  the  user  Automated  actions  you  take  on  Tweets  or  accounts  Automated  likes  You  may  not  like  Tweets  in  an  automated  manner  Automated  Retweets  Provided  you  comply  with  all  other  rules  you  may  Retweet  or  Quote  Tweet  in  an  automated  manner  for  entertainment  informational  or  novelty  purposes  Automated  Retweets  often  lead  to  negative  user  experiences  and  bulk  aggressive  or  spammy  Retweeting  is  a  violation  of  the  Twitter  Rules  Automated  You  may  not  follow  or  unfollow  Twitter  accounts  in  a  bulk  aggressive  or  indiscriminate  manner  Aggressive  following  is  a  violation  of  the  Twitter  Rules  Please  also  review  our  following  rules  and  best  practices  to  ensure  you  are  in  compliance  Note  that  applications  that  claim  to  get  users  more  followers  are  also  prohibited  under  the  Twitter  Rules  Automated  adding  to  lists  or  collections  You  may  not  add  Twitter  users  to  lists  or  add  Tweets  to  collections  in  a  bulk  or  indiscriminate  manner  Adding  a  large  number  of  unrelated  users  to  lists  is  a  violation  of  the  Twitter  Rules' , 'subSecction': []  } , { 'title' : 'About Twitter’s APIs' , 'url':

access  Twitter  via  the  web  or  your  mobile  device  To  share  information  on  Twitter  as  widely  as  possible  we  also  provide  companies  developers  and  users  with  programmatic  access  to  Twitter  data  through  our  APIs  application  programming  interfaces  This  article  explains  what  Twitter  s  APIs  are  what  information  is  made  available  through  them  and  some  of  the  protections  Twitter  has  in  place  for  their  use  At  a  high  level  APIs  are  the  way  computer  programs  talk  to  each  other  so  that  they  can  request  and  deliver  information  This  is  done  by  allowing  a  software  application  to  call  what  known  as  an  endpoint  an  address  that  corresponds  with  a  specific  type  of  information  we  provide  endpoints  are  generally  unique  like  phone  numbers  Twitter  allows  access  to  parts  of  our  service  via  APIs  to  allow  people  to  build  software  that  integrates  with  Twitter  like  a  solution  that  helps  a  company  respond  to  customer  feedback  on  Twitter  Twitter  data  is  unique  from  data  shared  by  most  other  social  platforms  because  it  reflects  information  that  users  choose  to  share  publicly  Our  API  platform  provides  broad  access  to  public  Twitter  data  that  users  have  chosen  to  share  with  the  world  We  also  support  APIs  that  allow  users  to  manage  their  own  Twitter  information  Direct  Messages  and  provide  this  information  to  developers  whom  they  have  authorized  to  do  so  Accessing  Twitter  Data  When  someone  wants  to  access  our  APIs  they  are  required  to  register  an  application  By  default  applications  can  only  access  public  information  on  Twitter  Certain  endpoints  such  as  those  responsible  for  sending  or  receiving  Direct  Messages  require  additional  permissions  from  you  before  they  can  access  your  information  These  permissions  are  not  granted  by  default  you  choose  on  a  basis  whether  to  provide  this  access  and  can  control  all  the  applications  authorized  on  your  account  The  Twitter  APIs  include  a  wide  range  of  endpoints  which  fall  into  five  primary  groups  Accounts  and  users  We  allow  developers  to  programmatically  manage  an  account  s  profile  and  settings  mute  or  block  users  manage  users  and  followers  request  information  about  an  authorized  account  s  activity  and  more  These  endpoints  can  help  citizen  services  like  the  Commonwealth  of  Virginia  s  Department  of  Emergency  Management  which  provides  information  to  residents  about  emergency  responses  and  emergency  alerts  Tweets  and  replies  We  make  public  Tweets  and  replies  available  to  developers  and  allow  developers  to  post  Tweets  via  our  API  Developers  can  access  Tweets  by  searching  for  specific  keywords  or  requesting  a  sample  of  Tweets  from  specific  accounts  These  endpoints  are  used  by  NGOs  like  the  UN  to  identify  understand  and  counter  misinformation  around  public  health  initiatives  For  example  in  Indonesia  there  were  persistent  rumors  that  vaccinations  either  contained  pork  product  or  caused  infertility  Understanding  how  the  rumors  started  and  were  spread  allowed  the  UN  to  get  a  team  on  the  ground  to  help  dispel  these  myths  which  caused  particular  concern  in  this  nation  Similarly  we  help  researchers  listen  for  early  symptomatic  indications  of  disease  outbreaks  and  monitor  their  spread  A  team  at  Northeastern  University  recently  developed  a  new  technique  using  Twitter  data  that  forecasts  outbreaks  up  to  six  weeks  in  advance  much  earlier  than  many  other  models  without  sacrificing  accuracy  Direct  Messages  Our  Direct  Message  endpoints  provide  access  to  the  DM  conversations  of  users  who  have  explicitly  granted  permission  to  a  specific  application  We  do  not  sell  Direct  Messages  Our  DM  APIs  provide  limited  access  to  developers  to  create  personalized

includes  the  Program  in  a  commercial  product  offering  should  do  so  in  a  manner  which  does  not  create  potential  liability  for  other  Contributors  Therefore  if  a  Contributor  includes  the  Program  in  a  commercial  product  offering  such  Contributor  Commercial  Contributor  hereby  agrees  to  defend  and  indemnify  every  other  Contributor  Indemnified

Contributor  in  the  defense  and  any  related  settlement  negotiations  The  Indemnified  Contributor  may  participate  in  any  such  claim  at  its  own  expense  For  example  a  Contributor  might  include  the  Program  in  a  commercial  product  offering  Product  X  That  Contributor  is  then  a  Commercial  Contributor  If  that  Commercial  Contributor  then  makes  performance  claims  or  offers  warranties  related  to  Product  X  those  performance  claims  and  warranties  are  such  Commercial  Contributor  responsibility  alone  Under  this  section  the  Commercial  Contributor  would  have  to  defend  claims  against  the  other  Contributors  related  to  those  performance  claims  and  warranties  and  if  a  court  requires  any  other  Contributor  to  pay  any  damages  as  a  result  the  Commercial  Contributor  must  pay  those  damages  NO  WARRANTY  EXCEPT  AS  EXPRESSLY  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS  AGREEMENT  THE  PROGRAM  IS  PROVIDED  ON  AN  AS  IS

 or  creators  of  original  content  instead  they  organize  and  present  compelling  content  that  already  exists  on  Twitter  in  a  straightforward  way  These  global  guidelines  are  designed  to  articulate  what  goes  into  making  the  best  experience  possible  for  both  consumers  of  content  and  those  whose  content  is  featured  in  Moments  Creating  great  Moments  Moments  is  designed  to  highlight  remarkable  content  on  Twitter  They  should  appeal  to  a  broad  audience  and  the  content  should  be  appropriate  for  all  parts  of  the  Twitter  community  Sometimes  Moments  will  parallel  what  is  relevant  on  the  world  stage  or  in  the  media  other  times  they  will  be  built  on  content  unique  to  Twitter  We  will  select  Moments  based  on  what  is  happening  on  Twitter  or  create  Moments  based  on  Twitter  content  featured  across  media  outlets  When  selecting  Moments  around  controversial  topics  we  will  choose  topics  that  are  big  news  in  the  mainstream  press  or  are  demonstrably  large  public  conversations  on  Twitter  We  avoid  creating  Moments  that  may  invade  privacy  encourage  illegal  activities  exploit  or  harm  minors  or  make  Twitter  a  focus  of  the  story  We  do  not  duplicate  curated  collections  or  sets  of  Tweets  embedded  on  a  single

 individual  voices  when  we  include  them  in  Moments  and  will  not  include  Tweets  in  a  way  that  misleads  substantially  changes  a  Tweet  s  original  context  or  includes  content

making  when  choosing  Tweets  around  controversial  topics  and  highlight  the  Tweets  already  receiving  the  most  engagement  on  Twitter  On  topics  which  reflect  public  debate  we  will

in  order  to  capitalize  on  the  unique  content  that  Twitter  enables  Here  are  some  considerations  for  creating  Moments  Every  Moment  should  provide  information  or  an  angle  that

Tweets  in  the  Moment  or  a  reiteration  of  content  from  these  Tweets  If  this  additional  text  is  not  sourced  from  a  Tweet  in  the  Moment  it  should  be  easily  verifiable  or  attributed  to  its  source  Avoiding  conflicts  of  interest  Our  Moments  curation  team  is  not  responsible  for  driving  revenue  user  growth  or  managing  Twitter  s  partner

We  take  action  at  the  Tweet  level  to  ensure  that  we  are  not  being  overly  harsh  with  an  otherwise  healthy  account  that  made  a  mistake  and  violated  our  Rules  A  few  of  the  ways  in  which  we  might  take  action  at  the  Tweet  level  include  Limiting  Tweet  visibility  This  makes  content  less  visible  on  Twitter  in  search  results  replies  and  on  timelines  Limiting  Tweet  visibility  depends  on  a  number  of  signals  about  the  nature  of  the  interaction  and  the  quality  of  the  content  Requiring  Tweet  removal  When  we  determine  that  a  Tweet  violated  the  Twitter  Rules  we  require  the  violator  to  remove  it  before  they  can  Tweet  again  We  send  an  email  notification  to  the  violator  identifying  the  Tweet  s  in  violation  and  which  policies  have  been  violated  They  will  then  need  to  go  through  the  process  of  removing  the  violating  Tweet  or  appealing  our  review  if

egregious  way  or  has  repeatedly  violated  them  even  after  receiving  notifications  from  us  Requiring  media  or  profile  edits  If  an  account  s  profile  or  media  content  is  not  compliant  with  our  policies  we  may  make  it  temporarily  unavailable  and  require  that  the  violator  edit  the  media  or  information  in  their  profile  to  come  into  compliance  We  also  explain  which  policy  their  profile  or  media  content  has  violated  Placing  an  account  in  mode  If  it  seems  like  an  otherwise  healthy  account  is  in  the  middle  of  an  abusive  episode  we  might  temporarily  make  their  account  limiting  their  ability  to  Tweet  Retweet  or  Like  content  until  calmer  heads  prevail  The  person  can  read  their  timelines  and  will  only  be  able  to  send  Direct  Messages  to  their  followers  When  an  account  is  in  mode  others  will  still  be  able  to  see  and  engage  with  the  account  The  duration  of  this  enforcement  action  can  range  from  hours  to  days  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  violation  Verifying  account  ownership  To  ensure  that  violators  do  not  abuse  the  anonymity  we  offer  and  harass  others  on  the  platform  we  may  require  the  account  owner  to  verify  ownership  with  a  phone  number  or  email  address  This  also  helps  us  identify  violators  who  are  operating  multiple  accounts  for  abusive  purposes  and  take  action  on  such  accounts  Note  that  when  an  account  has  been  locked  pending  completion  of  a  challenge  such  as  being  required  to  provide  a  phone  number  it  is  removed  from  follower  counts  Retweets  and  likes  until  it  provides  a  phone  number  Permanent  suspension  This  is  our  most  severe  enforcement  action  Permanently  suspending  an  account  will  remove  it  from  global  view  and  the  violator  will  not  be  allowed  to  create  new  accounts  When  we  permanently  suspend  an  account  we  notify  people  that  they  have  been  suspended  for  abuse  violations  and  explain  which  policy  or  policies  they  have  violated  and  which  content  was  in  violation  Violators  can  appeal  permanent  suspensions  if  they  believe  we  made  an  error  They  can  do  this  through  the  platform  interface  or  by  filing  a  report  Upon  appeal  if  we  find  that  a  suspension  is  valid  we  respond  to  the  appeal  with  information  on  the  policy  that  the  account  has  violated  Actions  we  may  take  against  content  Placing  a  Tweet  behind  an  interstitial  We  may  place  some  forms  of  sensitive  media  like  adult  content  or  graphic  violence  behind  an  interstitial  advising  viewers  to  be  aware

strive  to  enforce  them  with  uniform  consistency  Learn  more  about  different  enforcement  actions  When  it  comes  to  enforcing  these  rules  we  are  committed  to  being  Fair  we  will

reporting  the  metrics  we  are  using  to  measure  health  and  by  publishing  a  regular  transparency  report  around  violations  of  our  rules  Our  policy  development  process  Creating  a  new  policy  or  making  a  policy  change  requires  research  around  trends  in  online  behavior  developing  clear  external  language  that  sets  expectations  around  what  s  allowed  and  creating  enforcement  guidance  for  reviewers  that  can  be  scaled  across  millions  of  Tweets  While  drafting  policy  language  we  gather  feedback  from  a  variety  of  internal  teams  as  well  as  our  Trust  Safety  Council  This  is  vital  to  ensure  we  are  considering  global  perspectives  around  the  changing  nature  of  online  speech  including  how  our  rules  are  applied  and  interpreted  in  different  cultural  and  social  contexts  Finally  we  train  our  global  review  teams  update  the  Twitter  Rules  and  start  enforcing  the  new  policy  Our  enforcement  philosophy  We  empower  people  to  understand  different  sides  of  an  issue  and  encourage  dissenting  opinions  and  viewpoints  to  be  discussed  openly  This  approach  allows  many  forms  of  speech  to  exist  on  our  platform  and  in  particular  promotes  counterspeech  speech  that  presents  facts  to  correct  misstatements  or  misperceptions  points  out  hypocrisy  or  contradictions  warns  of  offline  or  online  consequences  denounces  hateful  or  dangerous  speech  or  helps  change  minds  and  disarm  Thus  context  matters  When  determining  whether  to  take  enforcement  action  we  may  consider  a  number  of  factors  including  but  not  limited  to  whether  the  behavior  is  directed  at  an  individual  group  or  protected  category  of  people  the  report  has  been  filed  by  the  target  of  the  abuse  or  a  bystander  the  user  has  a  history  of  violating  our  policies  the  severity  of  the  violation  the

to  be  expressed  on  the  platform  and  protecting  our  users  we  enforce  policies  when  someone  reports  abusive  behavior  that  targets  a  specific  person  or  group  of  people  This  targeting  can  happen  in  a  number  of  ways  for  example  mentions  tagging  a  photo  mentioning  them  by  name  and  more  Has  the  report  been  filed  by  the  target  of  the  potential  abuse  or  a  bystander  Some  Tweets  may  seem  to  be  abusive  when  viewed  in  isolation  but  may  not  be  when  viewed  in  the  context  of  a  larger  conversation  or  historical  relationship  between  people  on  the  platform  For  example  friendly  banter  between  friends  could  appear  offensive  to  bystanders  and  certain  remarks  that  are  acceptable  in  one  culture  or  country  may  not  be  acceptable  in  another  To  help  prevent  our  teams  from  making  a  mistake  and  removing  consensual  interactions  in  certain  scenarios  we  require  a  report  from  the  actual  target  or  their  authorized  representative  prior  to  taking  any  enforcement  action  Does  the  user  have  a  history  of  violating  our  policies  We  start  from  a  position  of  assuming  that  people  do  not  intend  to  violate  our  Rules  Unless  a  violation  is  so  egregious  that  we  must  immediately  suspend  an  account  we  first  try  to  educate  people  about  our  Rules  and  give  them  a  chance  to  correct  their  behavior  We  show  the  violator  the  offending  Tweet  s  explain  which  Rule  was  broken  and  require  them  to  remove  the  content  before  they  can  Tweet  again  If  someone  repeatedly  violates  our  Rules  then  our  enforcement  actions  become  stronger  This  includes  requiring  violators  to  remove  the  Tweet  s  and  taking  additional  actions  like  verifying  account  ownership  temporarily  limiting  their  ability  to  Tweet  for  a  set  period  of  time  If  someone  continues  to  violate  Rules  beyond  that  point  then  their  account  may  be  permanently  suspended  What  is  the  severity  of  the  violation  Certain  types  of  behavior  may  pose  serious  safety  and  security  risks  result  in  physical  emotional  and  financial  hardship  for  the  people  involved  These  egregious  violations  of  the  Twitter  Rules  such  as  posting  violent  threats  intimate  media  or  content  that  sexually  exploits  children  result  in  the  immediate  and  permanent  suspension  of  an  account  Other  violations  could  lead  to  a  range  of  different  steps  like  requiring  someone  to  remove  the  offending  Tweet  s  temporarily  limiting  their  ability  to  post  new  Tweet  s  Is  the  behavior  newsworthy  and  in  the  legitimate  public  interest  Twitter  moves  at  the  speed  of  public  consciousness  and  people  come  to  the  service  to  stay  informed  about  what  matters  Exposure  to  different  viewpoints  can  help  people  learn  from  one  another  become  more  tolerant  and  make  decisions  about  the  type  of  society  we  want  to  live  in  To  help  ensure  people  have  an  opportunity  to  see  every  side  of  an  issue  there  may  be  the  rare  occasion  when  we  allow  controversial  content  or  behavior  which  may  otherwise  violate  our  Rules  to  remain  on  our  service  because  we  believe  there  is  a  legitimate  public  interest  in  its  availability  Each  situation  is  evaluated  on  a  case  by  case  basis  and  ultimately  decided  upon  by  a  team  Some  of  the  factors  that  help  inform  our  about  content  are  the  impact  it  may  have  on  the  public  the  source  of  the  content  and  the  availability  of  alternative  coverage  of  an  event  Public  impact  of  the  content  A  topic  of  legitimate  public  interest  is  different  from  a  topic  in  which  the  public  may  be  curious  We  will  consider  what  the  impact  is  to  citizens  if  they  do  not  know  about  this  content  If  the  Tweet  does  have  the  potential  to  impact  the  lives  of  large  numbers  of  people  the  running  of  a  country  it  speaks  to  an  important  societal  issue  then  we  may  allow  the  the  content  to  remain  on  the  service  Likewise  if  the  impact  on  the  public  is  minimal  we  will  most  likely  remove  content  in  violation  of  our  policies  Source  of  the  content  Some  people  groups  organizations  and  the  content  they  post  on  Twitter  may  be  considered  a  topic  of  legitimate  public  interest  by  virtue  of  their  being  in  the  public  consciousness  This  does  not  mean  that  their  Tweets  will  always  remain  on  the  service  Rather  we  will  consider  if  there  is  a  legitimate  public  interest  for  a  particular  Tweet  to  remain  up  so  it  can  be  openly  discussed  Availability  of  coverage  Everyday  people  play  a  crucial  role  in  providing  firsthand  accounts  of  what  s  happening  in  the  world  counterpoints  to  establishment  views  and  in  some  cases  exposing  the  abuse  of  power  by  someone  in  a  position  of  authority  As  a  situation  unfolds  removing  access  to  certain  information  could  inadvertently  hide  context  prevent  people  from  seeing  every  side  of  the  issue  Thus  before  actioning  a  potentially  violating  Tweet  we  will  take  into  account  the  role  it  plays  in  showing  the  larger  story  and  whether  that  content  can  be  found  elsewhere' ,

from  which  the  request  originated  For  content  removal  requests  this  may  mean  the  reported  content  violates  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  and  the  content  will  be  removed  from  the  Twitter  platform  Or  perhaps  the  content  is  determined  to  be  illegal  in  a  particular  jurisdiction  and  Twitter  will  withhold  access  to  the  identified  content  in  the  location  in  which  it  is  alleged  to  be  in  violation  of  local  law  For  information  requests  Twitter  may  file  or  serve  objections  for  requests  that  are  legally  defective  overly  broad  appear  to  impermissibly  burden  free  expression  Twitter  also  checks  whether  the  user  s  filed  any  objections  with  the  appropriate  court  For  valid  and  properly  scoped  information  requests  where  there  has  not  been  a  successful  objection  by  Twitter  or  the  user  s  a  Twitter  agent  will  assemble  the  required  account  records  and  produce  them  electronically  through  our  secure  LRS  site  to  the  requester  Once  the  records  have  been  produced  the  case  is  considered  completed  and  closed  unless  we  re  able  to  provide  delayed  notice  to  affected  users  after  the  expiration  of  an  associated  order Frequently  asked  questions  about  legal  requests  How  will  I  know  if  I  got  a  notice  from  Twitter  regarding  a  legal  request  Twitter  attempts  to  alert  you  about  a  legal  request  we  have  received  via  the  email  address  associated  with  your  account  We  may  have  difficulty  delivering  notice  to  users  who  do  not  have  a  current  or  valid  email  address  associated  with  the  Twitter  account  Why  did  Twitter  tell  me  about  the  request  Transparency  and  user  empowerment  are  two  of  our  guiding  principles  at  Twitter  While  you  may  be  concerned  by  this  type  of  notice  we  want  you  to  know  that  the  request  exists  and  that  we  may  be  compelled  to  take  some  action  such  as  producing  account  information  or  withholding  content  Before  taking  action  we  want  to  provide  you  with  an  opportunity  to  review  the  legal  request  and  the  option  to  take  measures  to  protect  your  interests  When  prior  notice  is  not  possible  you  may  receive  delayed  notice  Delayed  notice  means  that  we  may  notify  you  about  the  existence  of  a  legal  request  after  Twitter  has  withheld  your  content  or  after  Twitter  has  been  compelled  to  disclose  information  associated  with  your  Twitter  account  We  attempt  to  notify  users  regarding  legal  requests  pertaining  to  their  accounts  however  we  may  be  legally  prohibited  from  doing  so  For  example  if  we  receive  a  legal  request  that  has  been  sealed  by  a  judge  we  are  not  permitted  to  communicate  about  the  request  until  the  confidentiality  obligation  expires  There  are  also  limited  policy  exceptions  to  providing  notice  such  as  emergencies  regarding  imminent  threats  to  life  incidents  involving  child  sexual  exploitation  or  acts  of  terrorism  when  we  do  not  provide  user  notice  What  types  of  legal  requests  does  Twitter  receive  Legal  requests  may  come  from  law  enforcement  government  agencies  lawyers  representing  a  criminal  defendant  civil  litigants  or  from  other  authorised  reporters  such  as  official  organisations  in  Europe  Information  requests  Law  enforcement  requests  for  account  information  are  usually  issued  in  connection  with  criminal  investigations  Twitter  also  receives  emergency  disclosure  requests  from  law  enforcement  If  we  receive  information  that  provides  us  with  a  good  faith  belief  that  there  is  an  exigent  emergency  involving  the  danger  of  death  or  serious  physical  injury  to  a  person  we  may  provide  information  necessary  to  prevent  that  harm  if  we  have  it  Civil  requests  for  account  information  are  typically  made  by  lawyers  in  connection  with  legal  actions  such  as  a  divorce  proceeding  or  a  business  dispute  Removal  requests  Twitter  sometimes  receives  legal  requests  alleging  that  content  posted  to  Twitter  may  be  illegal  in  one  or  more  countries  around  the  world  For  example  content  may  be  alleged  to  violate  laws  related  to  defamation  illegal  activities  or  national  security  Requests  may  also  be  reporting  content  that  is  potentially  in  violation  of  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  Can  I  get  more  information  about  the  legal  requests  that  Twitter  receives  Twice  a  year  Twitter  publishes  a  transparency  report  that  includes  details  about  the  government  and  requests  we  receive  We  provide  information  about  our  compliance  rate  which  countries  make  the  most  requests  and  any  trends  we  noticed  during  the  reported  time  frame  We  encourage  you  to  read  through  our  report  as  well  as  those  of  other  providers  whose  services  you  use  to  stay  informed  about  the  impact  of  these  requests  Questions  about  information  requests  What  types  of  account  information  may  be  produced  in  response  to  a  valid  legal  request  Obtaining  information  such  as  an  email  address  used  to  for  an  account  or  IP  login  information  requires  valid  legal  process  like  a  subpoena  court  order  or  other  local  legal  process  depending  on  the  country  that  issues  the  request  Requests  for  the  contents  of  communications  Tweets  Direct  Messages  media  require  a  valid  search  warrant  or  equivalent  to  be  properly  served  on  the  correct  Twitter  corporate  entity  Law  enforcement  or  government  agents  must  demonstrate  a  higher  burden  of  proof  before  a  judge  will  authorize  such  a  request  For  additional  information  on  the  types  of  legal  process  required  to  obtain  specific  types  of  account  information  please  see  the  Types  of  Legal  Process  section  in  our  transparency  report  and  Twitter  s  Guidelines  for  Law  Enforcement Note  Twitter  makes  your  IP  logs  and  some  other  account  information  available  directly  to  you  when  logged  into  your  Twitter  account  For  more  details  please  refer  to  this  article  about  accessing  your  Twitter  data Does  Twitter  always  turn  over  all  of  the  information  requested  by  valid  legal  requests  No  Twitter  may  seek  to  narrow  requests  that  are  overly  broad  request  additional  context  if  the  nature  of  the  investigation  is  not  clear  or  push  back  on  the  request  for  other  reasons  For  example  Twitter  may  receive  requests  for  contents  of  communications  such  as  Direct  Messages  DMs  or  Tweets  from  countries  outside  of  the  United  States  We  generally  refer  the  requester  to  the  procedures  available  under  a  mutual  legal  assistance  treaty  MLAT  or  letter  rogatory  and  do  not  provide  contents  of  communication  in  response  to  the  local  legal  process Questions  about  removal  requests  How  does  Twitter  determine  whether  or  not  it  will  remove  my  content  and  how  will  I  know  The  outcome  is  different  depending  on  whether  the  reported  content  violates  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  or  whether  it  is  alleged  to  be  illegal  in  a  certain  jurisdiction  but  does  not  otherwise  violate  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  If  the  reported  content  violates  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  It  is  removed  from  the  Twitter  platform  You  will  get  a  message  that  your  account  has  been  suspended  or  locked  when  you  The  message  may  say  that  you  need  to  take  certain  actions  before  you  use  your  account  certain  violations  or  in  case  of  repeat  infringements  your  account  may  be  permanently  suspended  For  more  information  about  suspended  or  locked  accounts  you  may  visit  our  dedicated  Help  Center  pages  If  the  reported  content  refers  to  sensitive  media  The  content  will  be  labelled  as  sensitive  so  other  users  may  choose  whether  or  not  they  wish  to  view  it  If  reported  content  does  not  violate  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  but  is  alleged  to  be  illegal  in  one  or  more  jurisdictions  Twitter  will  attempt  to  notify  you  that  we  have  received  a  legal  request  claiming  the  content  of  your  account  is  potentially  illegal  We  will  include  a  copy  of  the  legal  request  unless  reason  we  do  this  is  so  users  may  choose  to  remove  the  content  at  issue  respond  directly  to  the  requester  if  possible  or  seek  legal  advice  to  challenge  the  request  before  we  may  take  any  action  on  the  reported  content  Our  notice  does  not  represent  legal  advice  that  certain  content  should  be  removed  It  is  only  meant  to  inform  you  that  certain  content  on  your  Twitter  account  has  been  identified  in  a  legal  request  so  you  can  decide  whether  or  how  you  will  respond  and  to  inform  you  that  it  may  be  necessary  for  us  to  take  action  on  the  reported  content  based  on  the  underlying  legal  request  We  may  withhold  access  to  the  identified  content  in  the  location  in  which  it  is  alleged  to  be  in  violation  of  local  means  that  other  users  trying  to  view  the  content  in  the  jurisdiction  where  it  was  reported  will  see  the  messaging  below  instead  For  a  Tweet For  an  account Note  It  is  the  location  of  the  viewer  that  matters  rather  than  the  location  of  the  reported  user  For  example  if  certain  content  is  reported  in  the  United  States  we  may  withhold  this  content  in  the  United  States  regardless  of  whether  the  person  who  Tweeted  the  content  is  located  in  the  United  States  or  another  country  For  more  information  please  see  our  country  withheld  content  article Can  I  appeal  Twitter  s  decision  to  withhold  my  content  If  you  believe  your  content  was  withheld  in  error  you  may  appeal  by  responding  directly  to  the  email  we  sent  notifying  you  of  the  withholding  if  based  on  a  legal  demand  or  by  contacting  us  through  our  Help  Center  if  withheld  based  on  local  law  What  is  Lumen  and  how  does  it  relate  to  Twitter  and  removal  requests  To  further  our  transparency  efforts  we  established  a  partnership  with  the  Lumen  project  formerly  Chilling  Effects  in  Lumen  is  an  independent  third  party  research  project  studying  cease  and  desist  letters  concerning  online  content  They  collect  and  analyse  complaints  about  online  activity  especially  requests  to  remove  content  Unless  we  are  prevented  from  doing  so  when  we  withhold  content  in  a  certain  country  and  also  for  DMCA  notices  Twitter  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  request  to  Lumen  so  anyone  can  see  what  type  of  content  was  removed  and  who  made  the  request  We  strive  to  provide  complete  information  to  Lumen  but  we  may  if  required  redact  certain  details  such  as  personal  addresses  or  phone  numbers  for  privacy  and  confidentiality  reasons  What  if  it  is  determined  that  my  Tweets  are  allowed  If  content  that  was  withheld  in  response  to  a  legal  request  becomes  allowed  in  the  future  where  we  can  we  will  restore  access  to  it  so  anyone  in  the  world  can  view  it  Some  circumstances  in  which  we  have  content  in  the  past  include  An  objection  filed  by  Twitter  against  a  court  order  deeming  certain  content  was  illegal  was  accepted  by  a  higher  court  An  objection  filed  by  a  user  against  a  court  order  deeming  certain  content  was  illegal  was  accepted  by  a  higher  validity  period  of  a  court  order  prohibiting  publication  of  certain  material  official  judicial  body  expressed  an
