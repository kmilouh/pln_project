country  Below  are  a  range  of  enforcement  options  that  we  may  exercise  when  conducting  a  review  enforcement  We  take  action  at  the  Tweet  level  to  ensure  that  we  are  not  being  overly  harsh  with  an  otherwise  healthy  account  that  made  a  mistake  and  violated  our  Rules  A  few  of  the  ways  in  which  we  might  take  action  at  the  Tweet  level  include  Limiting  Tweet  visibility  This  makes  content  less  visible  on  Twitter  in  search  results  replies  and  on  timelines  Limiting  Tweet  visibility  depends  on  a  number  of  signals  about  the  nature  of  the  interaction  and  the  quality  of  the  content  Requiring  Tweet  removal  When  we  determine  that  a  Tweet  violated  the  Twitter  Rules  we  require  the  violator  to  remove  it  before  they  can  Tweet  again  We  send  an  email  notification  to  the  violator  identifying  the  Tweet  s  in  violation  and  which  policies  have  been  violated  They  will  then  need  to  go  through  the  process  of  removing  the  violating  Tweet  or  appealing  our  review  if  they  believe  we  made  an  error  Hiding  a  violating  Tweet  while  awaiting  its  removal  In  the  interim  period  between  when  Twitter  takes  enforcement  action  and  the  person  removes  the  Tweet  we  hide  that  Tweet  from  public  view  and  will  replace  the  original  content  with  a  notice  stating  that  the  Tweet  is  no  longer  available  because  it  violated  our  Rules  Additionally  this  notice  will  be  available  for  days  after  Tweet  removed  Where  this  notice  is  available  The  details  page  of  the  Tweet  in  violation  on  Twitter  for  iOS  and  Android  and  profile  page  of  the  account  in  violation

any  Twitter  on  Direct  enforcement  Stopping  conversations  between  a  reported  violator  and  the  reporter  s  account  In  a  private  Direct  Message  conversation  when  a  participant  reports  the  other  person  we  will  stop  the  violator  from  sending  messages  to  the  person  who  reported  them  The  conversation  will  also  be  removed  from  the  reporter  inbox  However  if  the  reporter  decides  to  continue  to  send  Direct  Messages  to  the  violator  the  conversation  will  resume  Placing  a  Direct  Message  behind  an  interstitial  In  a  group  Direct  Message  conversation  the  violating  Direct  Message  may  be  placed  behind  an  interstitial  to  ensure  no  one  else  in  the  group  can  see  it  again  enforcement  We  take  action  at  the  account  level  if  we  determine  that  a  person  has  violated  the  Twitter  Rules  in  a  particularly  egregious  way  or  has  repeatedly  violated  them  even  after  receiving  notifications  from  us  Requiring  media  or  profile  edits  If  an  account  s  profile  or  media  content  is  not  compliant  with  our  policies  we  may  make  it  temporarily  unavailable  and  require  that  the  violator  edit  the  media  or  information  in  their  profile  to  come  into  compliance  We  also  explain  which  policy  their  profile  or  media  content  has  violated  Placing  an  account  in  mode  If  it  seems  like  an  otherwise  healthy  account  is  in  the  middle  of  an  abusive  episode  we  might  temporarily  make  their  account  limiting  their  ability  to  Tweet  Retweet  or  Like  content  until  calmer  heads  prevail  The  person  can  read  their  timelines  and  will  only  be  able  to  send  Direct  Messages  to  their  followers  When  an  account  is  in  mode  others  will  still  be  able  to  see  and  engage  with  the  account  The  duration  of  this  enforcement  action  can  range  from  hours  to  days  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  violation  Verifying  account  ownership  To  ensure  that  violators  do  not  abuse  the  anonymity  we  offer  and  harass  others  on  the  platform  we  may  require  the  account  owner  to  verify  ownership  with  a  phone  number  or  email  address  This  also  helps  us  identify  violators  who  are  operating  multiple  accounts  for  abusive  purposes  and  take  action  on  such  accounts  Note  that  when  an  account  has  been  locked  pending  completion  of  a  challenge  such  as  being  required  to  provide  a  phone  number  it  is  removed  from  follower  counts  Retweets  and  likes  until  it  provides  a  phone  number  Permanent  suspension  This  is  our  most  severe  enforcement  action  Permanently  suspending  an  account  will  remove  it  from  global  view  and  the  violator  will  not  be  allowed  to  create  new  accounts  When  we  permanently  suspend  an  account  we  notify  people  that  they  have  been  suspended  for  abuse  violations  and  explain  which  policy  or  policies  they  have  violated  and  which  content  was  in  violation  Violators  can  appeal  permanent  suspensions  if  they  believe  we  made  an  error  They  can  do  this  through  the  platform  interface  or  by  filing  a  report  Upon  appeal  if  we  find  that  a  suspension  is  valid  we  respond  to  the  appeal  with  information  on  the  policy  that  the  account  has  violated  Actions  we  may  take  against  content  Placing  a  Tweet  behind  an  interstitial  We  may  place  some  forms  of  sensitive  media  like  adult  content  or  graphic  violence  behind  an  interstitial  advising  viewers  to  be  aware  that  they  will  see  sensitive  media  if  they  click  through  This  allows  us  to  identify  potentially  sensitive  content  that  some  people  may  not  wish  to  see  Learn  more  about  how  to  control  whether  you  see  sensitive  media  Withholding  a  Tweet  or  account  in  a  country  We  may  withhold  access  to  certain  content  in  a  particular  country  if  we  receive  a  valid  and  properly  scoped  request  from  an  authorized  entity  in  that  country  We  also  clearly  indicate  within  the  product  when  content  has  been  withheld  Read  more  about  country  withheld  content",

 by  publishing  a  regular  transparency  report  around  violations  of  our  rules  Our  policy  development  process  Creating  a  new  policy  or  making  a  policy  change  requires  research  around  trends  in  online  behavior  developing  clear  external  language  that  sets  expectations  around  what  s  allowed  and  creating  enforcement  guidance  for  reviewers  that  can  be  scaled  across  millions  of  Tweets  While  drafting  policy  language  we  gather  feedback  from  a  variety  of  internal  teams  as  well  as  our  Trust  Safety  Council  This  is  vital  to  ensure  we  are  considering  global  perspectives  around  the  changing  nature  of  online  speech  including  how  our  rules  are  applied  and  interpreted  in  different  cultural  and  social  contexts  Finally  we  train  our  global  review  teams  update  the  Twitter  Rules  and  start  enforcing  the  new  policy  Our  enforcement  philosophy  We  empower  people  to  understand  different  sides  of  an  issue  and  encourage  dissenting  opinions  and  viewpoints  to  be  discussed  openly  This  approach  allows  many  forms  of  speech  to  exist  on  our  platform  and

 Is  the  behavior  directed  at  an  individual  or  group  of  people  To  strike  a  balance  between  allowing  different  opinions  to  be  expressed  on  the  platform  and  protecting  our  users  we  enforce  policies  when  someone  reports  abusive  behavior  that  targets  a  specific  person  or  group  of  people  This  targeting  can  happen  in  a  number  of  ways  for  example

representative  prior  to  taking  any  enforcement  action  Does  the  user  have  a  history  of  violating  our  policies  We  start  from  a  position  of  assuming  that  people  do  not  intend  to  violate  our  Rules  Unless  a  violation  is  so  egregious  that  we  must  immediately  suspend  an  account  we  first  try  to  educate  people  about  our  Rules  and  give  them  a  chance  to  correct  their  behavior  We  show  the  violator  the  offending  Tweet  s  explain  which  Rule  was  broken  and  require  them  to  remove  the  content  before  they  can  Tweet  again  If  someone  repeatedly  violates  our  Rules  then  our  enforcement  actions  become  stronger  This  includes  requiring  violators  to  remove  the  Tweet  s  and  taking  additional  actions  like  verifying  account  ownership  temporarily  limiting  their  ability  to  Tweet  for  a  set  period  of  time  If  someone  continues  to  violate  Rules  beyond  that  point  then  their  account  may  be  permanently  suspended  What  is  the  severity  of  the  violation  Certain  types  of  behavior  may  pose  serious  safety  and  security  risks  result  in  physical  emotional  and  financial  hardship  for  the  people  involved  These  egregious  violations  of  the  Twitter  Rules  such  as  posting  violent  threats  intimate  media  or  content  that  sexually  exploits  children  result  in  the  immediate  and  permanent  suspension  of  an  account  Other  violations  could  lead  to  a  range  of  different  steps  like  requiring  someone  to  remove  the  offending  Tweet  s  temporarily  limiting  their  ability  to  post  new  Tweet  s  Is  the  behavior  newsworthy  and  in  the  legitimate  public  interest  Twitter  moves  at  the  speed  of  public  consciousness  and  people  come  to  the  service  to  stay  informed  about  what  matters  Exposure  to  different  viewpoints  can  help  people  learn  from  one  another  become  more  tolerant  and  make  decisions  about  the  type  of  society  we  want  to  live  in  To  help  ensure  people  have  an  opportunity  to  see  every  side  of  an  issue  there  may  be  the  rare  occasion  when  we  allow  controversial  content  or  behavior  which  may  otherwise  violate  our  Rules  to  remain  on  our  service  because  we  believe  there  is  a  legitimate  public  interest  in  its  availability  Each  situation  is  evaluated  on  a  case  by  case  basis  and  ultimately  decided  upon  by  a  team  Some  of  the  factors  that  help  inform  our  about  content  are  the  impact  it  may  have  on  the  public  the  source  of  the  content  and  the  availability  of  alternative  coverage  of  an  event  Public  impact  of  the  content  A  topic  of  legitimate  public  interest  is  different  from  a  topic  in  which  the  public  may  be  curious  We  will  consider  what  the  impact  is  to  citizens  if  they  do  not  know  about  this  content  If  the  Tweet  does  have  the  potential  to  impact  the  lives  of  large  numbers  of  people  the  running  of  a  country  it  speaks  to  an  important  societal  issue  then  we  may  allow  the  the  content  to  remain  on  the  service  Likewise  if  the  impact  on  the  public  is  minimal  we  will  most  likely  remove  content  in  violation  of  our  policies  Source  of  the  content  Some  people  groups  organizations  and  the  content  they  post  on  Twitter  may  be  considered  a  topic  of  legitimate  public  interest  by  virtue  of  their  being  in  the  public  consciousness  This  does  not  mean  that  their  Tweets  will  always  remain  on  the  service  Rather  we  will  consider  if  there  is  a  legitimate  public  interest  for  a  particular  Tweet  to  remain  up  so  it  can  be  openly  discussed  Availability  of  coverage  Everyday  people  play  a  crucial  role  in  providing  firsthand  accounts  of  what  s  happening  in  the  world  counterpoints  to  establishment  views  and  in  some  cases  exposing  the  abuse  of  power  by  someone  in  a  position  of  authority  As  a  situation  unfolds  removing  access  to  certain  information  could  inadvertently  hide  context  prevent  people  from  seeing  every  side  of  the  issue  Thus  before  actioning  a  potentially  violating  Tweet  we  will  take  into  account  the  role  it  plays  in  showing  the  larger  story  and  whether  that  content  can  be  found  elsewhere",

advice  and  can  not  provide  any  further  information  beyond  what  we  provided  in  our  notice  If  you  wish  to  seek  legal  counsel  here  are  some  resources  that  may  help  For  legal  requests  you  might  consider  contacting  the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  http  or  the  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation  https  For  legal  requests  you  might  consider  contacting  a

services  available  in  your  location  More  general  information  about  the  different  types  of  legal  requests  we  receive  is  available  below  What  happens  when  Twitter  receives  a  legal  request  Below  you  will  find  a  process  outlining  the  life  cycle  of  a  typical  legal  request  request  submitted  to  Twitter  Submission  process  A  legal  request  for  information  about  a  Twitter  account  is  first  submitted  to  Twitter  via  email  mail  fax  or  our  Legal  Request  Submissions  Site  LRS  https  by  law  enforcement  a  government  agency  a  lawyer  representing  a  criminal  defendant  or  a  civil  litigant  Preliminary  review  A  Twitter  agent  first  reviews  the  legal  request  to  determine  whether  it  meets  relevant  statutory  requirements  If  the  request  meets  all  relevant  statutory  requirements  a  Twitter  agent  will  then  review  the  reported  account  or  Tweets  for  any  indications  that  the  request  seeks  to  restrict  or  chill  freedom  of  expression  raises  other  Twitter  policy  concerns  accounts  belonging  to  journalists  verified  accounts  or  accounts  containing  political  speech  or  raises  practical  or  technical  concerns  the  account  or  content  at  issue  is  no  longer  available  During  this  step  Twitter  may  ask  the  requester  for  additional  context  before  considering  any  responsive  disclosure  or  taking  action  on  the  account  or  pushing  back  on  the  request  in  its  entirety  due  to  various  circumstances  nature  of  the  underlying  crime  request  is  overbroad  request  is  missing  a  required  signature  request  for  content  with  the  incorrect  legal  process  User  notice  By  default  Twitter  will  attempt  to  notify  the  reported  account  holder  s  of  the  existence  of  a  legal  request  pertaining  to  the  account  s  if  we  are  not  otherwise  prohibited  from  doing  so  Exceptions  to  user  notice  may  include  exigent  circumstances  such  as  emergencies  regarding  imminent  threats  to  life  child  sexual  exploitation  or  terrorism  Twitter  attempts  to  notify  the  user  s  about  the  legal  request  through  a  notification  in  the  Twitter  app  and  by  sending  a  message  to  the  email  address  associated  with  the  account  s  if  available  If  we  are  not  permitted  to  notify  the  user  s  at  this  step  in  the  process  because  the  legal  request  is  accompanied  by  a  order  we  may  notify  the  user  s  about  the  existence  of  a  legal  request  after  Twitter  has  withheld  the  reported  content  or  disclosed  information  associated  with  the  Twitter  account  s  Twitter  s  Response  The  Twitter  agent  then  applies  our  company  policies  for  handling  legal  requests  which  may  differ  depending  on  the  jurisdiction  from  which  the  request  originated  For  content  removal  requests  this  may  mean  the  reported  content  violates  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  and  the  content  will  be  removed  from  the  Twitter  platform  Or  perhaps  the  content  is  determined  to  be  illegal  in  a  particular  jurisdiction  and  Twitter  will  withhold  access  to  the  identified  content  in  the  location  in  which  it  is  alleged  to  be  in  violation  of  local  law  For  information  requests  Twitter  may  file  or  serve  objections  for  requests  that  are  legally  defective  overly  broad  appear  to  impermissibly  burden  free  expression  Twitter  also  checks  whether  the  user  s  filed  any  objections  with  the  appropriate  court  For  valid  and  properly  scoped  information  requests  where  there  has  not  been  a  successful  objection  by  Twitter  or  the  user  s  a  Twitter  agent  will  assemble  the  required  account  records  and  produce  them  electronically  through  our  secure  LRS  site  to  the  requester  Once  the  records  have  been  produced  the  case  is  considered  completed  and  closed  unless  we  re  able  to  provide  delayed  notice  to  affected  users  after  the  expiration  of  an  associated  order Frequently  asked  questions  about  legal  requests  How  will  I  know  if  I  got  a  notice  from  Twitter  regarding  a  legal  request  Twitter  attempts  to  alert  you  about  a  legal  request  we  have  received  via  the  email  address  associated  with  your  account  We  may  have  difficulty  delivering  notice  to  users  who  do  not  have  a  current  or  valid  email  address  associated  with  the  Twitter  account  Why  did  Twitter  tell  me  about  the  request  Transparency  and  user  empowerment  are  two  of  our  guiding  principles  at  Twitter  While  you  may  be  concerned  by  this  type  of  notice  we  want  you  to  know  that  the  request  exists  and  that  we  may  be  compelled  to  take  some  action  such  as  producing  account  information  or  withholding  content  Before  taking  action  we  want  to  provide  you  with  an  opportunity  to  review  the  legal  request  and  the  option  to  take  measures  to  protect  your  interests  When  prior  notice  is  not  possible  you  may  receive  delayed  notice  Delayed  notice  means  that  we  may  notify  you  about  the  existence  of  a  legal  request  after  Twitter  has  withheld  your  content  or  after  Twitter  has  been  compelled  to  disclose  information  associated  with  your  Twitter  account  We  attempt  to  notify  users  regarding  legal  requests  pertaining  to  their  accounts  however  we  may  be  legally  prohibited  from  doing  so  For  example  if  we  receive  a  legal  request  that  has  been  sealed  by  a  judge  we  are  not  permitted  to  communicate  about  the  request  until  the  confidentiality  obligation  expires  There  are  also  limited  policy  exceptions  to  providing  notice  such  as  emergencies  regarding  imminent  threats  to  life  incidents  involving  child  sexual  exploitation  or  acts  of  terrorism  when  we  do  not  provide  user  notice  What  types  of  legal  requests  does  Twitter  receive  Legal  requests  may  come  from  law  enforcement  government  agencies  lawyers  representing  a  criminal  defendant  civil  litigants  or  from  other  authorised  reporters  such  as  official  organisations  in  Europe  Information  requests  Law  enforcement  requests  for  account  information  are  usually  issued  in  connection  with  criminal  investigations  Twitter  also  receives  emergency  disclosure  requests  from  law  enforcement  If  we  receive  information  that  provides  us  with  a  good  faith  belief  that  there  is  an  exigent  emergency  involving  the  danger  of  death  or  serious  physical  injury  to  a  person  we  may  provide  information  necessary  to  prevent  that  harm  if  we  have  it  Civil  requests  for  account  information  are  typically  made  by  lawyers  in  connection  with  legal  actions  such  as  a  divorce  proceeding  or  a  business  dispute  Removal  requests  Twitter  sometimes  receives  legal  requests  alleging  that  content  posted  to  Twitter  may  be  illegal  in  one  or  more  countries  around  the  world  For  example  content  may  be  alleged  to  violate  laws  related  to  defamation  illegal  activities  or  national  security  Requests  may  also  be  reporting  content  that  is  potentially  in  violation  of  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  Can  I  get  more  information  about  the  legal  requests  that  Twitter  receives  Twice  a  year  Twitter  publishes  a  transparency  report  that  includes  details  about  the  government  and  requests  we  receive  We  provide  information  about  our  compliance  rate  which  countries  make  the  most  requests  and  any  trends  we  noticed  during  the  reported  time  frame  We  encourage  you  to  read  through  our  report  as  well  as  those  of  other  providers  whose  services  you  use  to  stay  informed  about  the  impact  of  these  requests  Questions  about  information  requests  What  types  of  account  information  may  be  produced  in  response  to  a  valid  legal  request  Obtaining  information  such  as  an  email  address  used  to  for  an  account  or  IP  login  information  requires  valid  legal  process  like  a  subpoena  court  order  or  other  local  legal  process  depending  on  the  country  that  issues  the  request  Requests  for  the  contents  of  communications  Tweets  Direct  Messages  media  require  a  valid  search  warrant  or  equivalent  to  be  properly  served  on  the  correct  Twitter  corporate  entity  Law  enforcement  or  government  agents  must  demonstrate  a  higher  burden  of  proof  before  a  judge  will  authorize  such  a  request  For  additional  information  on  the  types  of  legal  process  required  to  obtain  specific  types  of  account  information  please  see  the  Types  of  Legal  Process  section  in  our  transparency  report  and  Twitter  s  Guidelines  for  Law  Enforcement Note  Twitter  makes  your  IP  logs  and  some  other  account  information  available  directly  to  you  when  logged  into  your  Twitter  account  For  more  details  please  refer  to  this  article  about  accessing  your  Twitter  data Does  Twitter  always  turn  over  all  of  the  information  requested  by  valid  legal  requests  No  Twitter  may  seek  to  narrow  requests  that  are  overly  broad  request  additional  context  if  the  nature  of  the  investigation  is  not  clear  or  push  back  on  the  request  for  other  reasons  For  example  Twitter  may  receive  requests  for  contents  of  communications  such  as  Direct  Messages  DMs  or  Tweets  from  countries  outside  of  the  United  States  We  generally  refer  the  requester  to  the  procedures  available  under  a  mutual  legal  assistance  treaty  MLAT  or  letter  rogatory  and  do  not  provide  contents  of  communication  in  response  to  the  local  legal  process Questions  about  removal  requests  How  does  Twitter  determine  whether  or  not  it  will  remove  my  content  and  how  will  I  know  The  outcome  is  different  depending  on  whether  the  reported  content  violates  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  or  whether  it  is  alleged  to  be  illegal  in  a  certain  jurisdiction  but  does  not  otherwise  violate  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  If  the  reported  content  violates  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  It  is  removed  from  the  Twitter  platform  You  will  get  a  message  that  your  account  has  been  suspended  or  locked  when  you  The  message  may  say  that  you  need  to  take  certain  actions  before  you  use  your  account  certain  violations  or  in  case  of  repeat  infringements  your  account  may  be  permanently  suspended  For  more  information  about  suspended  or  locked  accounts  you  may  visit  our  dedicated  Help  Center  pages  If  the  reported  content  refers  to  sensitive  media  The  content  will  be  labelled  as  sensitive  so  other  users  may  choose  whether  or  not  they  wish  to  view  it  If  reported  content  does  not  violate  Twitter  s  Terms  of  Service  or  Rules  but  is  alleged  to  be  illegal  in  one  or  more  jurisdictions  Twitter  will  attempt  to  notify  you  that  we  have  received  a  legal  request  claiming  the  content  of  your  account  is  potentially  illegal  We  will  include  a  copy  of  the  legal  request  unless  reason  we  do  this  is  so  users  may  choose  to  remove  the  content  at  issue  respond  directly  to  the  requester  if  possible  or  seek  legal  advice  to  challenge  the  request  before  we  may  take  any  action  on  the  reported  content  Our  notice  does  not  represent  legal  advice  that  certain  content  should  be  removed  It  is  only  meant  to  inform  you  that  certain  content  on  your  Twitter  account  has  been  identified  in  a  legal  request  so  you  can  decide  whether  or  how  you  will  respond  and  to  inform  you  that  it  may  be  necessary  for  us  to  take  action  on  the  reported  content  based  on  the  underlying  legal  request  We  may  withhold  access  to  the  identified  content  in  the  location  in  which  it  is  alleged  to  be  in  violation  of  local  means  that  other  users  trying  to  view  the  content  in  the  jurisdiction  where  it  was  reported  will  see  the  messaging  below  instead  For  a  Tweet For  an  account Note  It  is  the  location  of  the  viewer  that  matters  rather  than  the  location  of  the  reported  user  For  example  if  certain  content  is  reported  in  the  United  States  we  may  withhold  this  content  in  the  United  States  regardless  of  whether  the  person  who  Tweeted  the  content  is  located  in  the  United  States  or  another  country  For  more  information  please  see  our  country  withheld  content  article Can  I  appeal  Twitter  s  decision  to  withhold  my  content  If  you  believe  your  content  was  withheld  in  error  you  may  appeal  by  responding  directly  to  the  email  we  sent  notifying  you  of  the  withholding  if  based  on  a  legal  demand  or  by  contacting  us  through  our  Help  Center  if  withheld  based  on  local  law  What  is  Lumen  and  how  does  it  relate  to  Twitter  and  removal  requests  To  further  our  transparency  efforts  we  established  a  partnership  with  the  Lumen  project  formerly  Chilling  Effects  in  Lumen  is  an  independent  third  party  research  project  studying  cease  and  desist  letters  concerning  online  content  They  collect  and  analyse  complaints  about  online  activity  especially  requests  to  remove  content  Unless  we  are  prevented  from  doing  so  when  we  withhold  content  in  a  certain  country  and  also  for  DMCA  notices  Twitter  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  request  to  Lumen  so  anyone  can  see  what  type  of  content  was  removed  and  who  made  the  request  We  strive  to  provide  complete  information  to  Lumen  but  we  may  if  required  redact  certain  details  such  as  personal  addresses  or  phone  numbers  for  privacy  and  confidentiality  reasons  What  if  it  is  determined  that  my  Tweets  are  allowed  If  content  that  was  withheld  in  response  to  a  legal  request  becomes  allowed  in  the  future  where  we  can  we  will  restore  access  to  it  so  anyone  in  the  world  can  view  it  Some  circumstances  in  which  we  have  content  in  the  past  include  An  objection  filed  by  Twitter  against  a  court  order  deeming  certain  content  was  illegal  was  accepted  by  a  higher  court  An  objection  filed  by  a  user  against  a  court  order  deeming  certain  content  was  illegal  was  accepted  by  a  higher  validity  period  of  a  court  order  prohibiting  publication  of  certain  material  official  judicial  body  expressed  an  opinion  that  a  request  made  by  an  administrative  authority  was
